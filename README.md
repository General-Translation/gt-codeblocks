I AM TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW GOD DAMN PACKAGES WORK, SO THIS IS NOT YET WORKING

This is a chatgpt code copy clone. I have the code working locally, so if you want a copy email adam.p.zakaria@gmail.com. Hopefully I can figure out this package situation in the next week (6/18/23)

I need to remove dependencies.

For the library:
App.css is found, the class is on the button, but tailwind is not coloring the text. it probably isn't getting loaded (it's probably not getting built and bundled.)
